Tasty if you get combinations right. Best combos will have something savory, sweet, and crunchy.\n\nThis place is amazing. Everyone is extremely friendly and the fish is super fresh for the Midwest. Make sure you keep your expectations in check though, we are landlocked by quite a distance.\n\nYou also get unlimited toppings with avacado and Kim chi being extra. I've had poke quite a bit on the coasts and have found that the best combinations tend to have a mix of something crunchy (chips or fried onion), something savory (spicy poke sauce, Kim chi), and something sweet (Thai sweet chili sauce, mango, or pineapple). My go to combo is white rice w/chips, ahi tuna, crab salad, seaweed salad, mango, green onion, fried onion, sweet Thai chili sauce, spicy mayo, sesame seeds, and togorashi seasoning.\n\nIf you can, I've found sharing a large bowl between two ppl is plenty of food, as long as you both can agree on toppings this is def the way to go and much cheaper than getting two bowls.\n\nSeating in the resteraunt is ample and it's always very clean and well lit. It's hard to beat a healthy, fresh, and quick resteraunt in cwe. People will naturally compare to.blk mrkt eats, both are delicious, but pokedoke bowls are def better than blk mrkt bowls.

Or was, anyhow, before I started going to Bike Revs. I bought my bike online, mostly pre-assembled, but knew I wasn't going to keep it stock. The first time I went to the shop, I was looking to replace the original seat and to pick up some wrap tape. I didn't have an exact idea in my head about what I wanted and I was completely blown away by the colorful selection of, well, everything!! I ended up grabbing a sparkley gold seat and awesome seafoam (\"celeste\") leatherette tape. Later that day, I went to my friend's house to have him set up my bike and we both kept talking about how awesome Bike Revs is. \n\nAfter a few days with my new bike, I realized the ultimate flaw in buying online and not trying out the bike first- the geometry of the frame in combination with the stock pedals with cages is totally wrong for trying to avoid getting hit by a turning short bus that doesn't use blinkers. When your foot is in a certain position, the cages make it impossible to turn the wheel at all, so I basically had to jump off my bike in order to not get run over by the short bus (how embarrassing would that have been? Hit by a short bus?? Ugh, it's like a bad joke.). Since I was at 4th and Lombard, I decided to stop by Bike Revs on my way home to switch out my pedals. Meghan(?) helped me out while I made my decision, talking me through the pros and cons of each style for my situation. (Thankfully she didn't even seem to care that I was all sweaty and frazzled after almost just dying!! haha) Since they were out of the particular style/color I wanted and I wanted new pedals immediately, I was going to settle for the same style in copper, but she knew I wasn't really satisfied with them and she suggested that I go check out Via to see if they had the ones I wanted. I love it when businesses recommend the competition so that the customer is ultimately happy. It makes me happy to be seen as a person and not a walking dollar sign. Via did end up having the pedals I wanted and the suggestion actually even increased my loyalty to Bike Revs. \n\nShortly after this, I got a front pinch flat and brought my tire in for a new tube. A few days later when I pinched out my back tire (on a 102 degree day and had to carry my bike on my shoulder all the way from 3rd & Lombard and was, again, embarrassingly sweaty and frazzled), everyone remembered me (even more loyalty points) and when I asked how I could avoid blowing tubes constantly, Bryan took the time to explain why/how it was happening (the skinny tires that came with my bike were no match for the streets of Philadelphia). When I told him that I wanted to prevent constant flats at any and all measures and wanted to change out my tires for more durable ones, he thoroughly explained the tires that would fit my bike, starting with the less expensive brand and not pushing the expensive ones at all. It was my own curiosity that led me to ask about the fancy tires and he pulled those down, along with the less expensive ones and handed me both so I could feel the difference between those and my original tires. Because I ride so much in South Philly around all the tracks and random sink holes that keep showing up everywhere, I decided on the thickest tires that would fit and Bryan then showed me how to change my tubes so I don't have to keep bringing my bike in if I flat out in the future. While he was setting my bike up with my new tires, he noticed that the bigger tires were rubbing a little bit, so he meticulously ground down a new little metal fitting until the tires worked perfectly... on the spot, for free!!! That solidified it- they've got a customer for life! I've had the new tires for about a month and they're AMAZING! I've ridden over all sorts of street surprises with no flats! Not only that, I check my tires religiously now before I go out and I haven't even needed to put air in them since! They're still going strong at 100 psi!!\n\nI had also asked about picking up another pack of my beloved celeste grip tape, which they were out of at the time, and they told me that they would order some for me (also cool). A few days later, I got a voicemail from Meghan (I'll feel like a real jerk if that's not her name), who sadly (but hilariously) informed me that fizik has discontinued the celeste leatherette, but told me how she knew how much I love it and gave me some suggestions of where I might be able to find some. I've been unsuccessful so far, but I'm not too upset about it as I know I'll find something I like just as much on my next trip to the shop.", "date": "2011-07-05 22:23:37"}, {"review_id": "pLFBmVwZeqjvudUczExLww", "user_id": "j0B8nz6TVmLzqYN6lNLiiQ", "business_id": "cV6qQ58k6hPYci5n8jxX5Q", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great service!

Located in a rather large strip center on East 82nd Street just East of Keystone at the Crossing, Bella Pizza is a four-location indiana mini-chain with locations in Keystone, Hamilton Town Center, Clay Terrace, and in Kokomo. Self-dubbed as a \"New York Style Eatery,\" one can only assume it's because the restaurant tends to be dirty as it's certainly not a description of the pizza. \n\nOkay, I'm sorry. That was a tad too snarky. \n\nBella offers pizza by the slice along with whole pies along with calzones, pasta, salads, breadsticks, a kids menu and some desserts. The location is next to a Mattress Firm  and not too far from Maggie Moo's. It happens to have a couple of accessible parking spots right in front of it, and while they're not quite ADA compliant I'd suspect most people won't have any trouble with them. You enter the front door and head straight toward an ordering counter. They do serve up several specials. I found their slice prices to be pretty workable, though I wasn't as impressed with their whole pie prices. They do offer delivery. \n\nI ordered a slice of sausage pizza, two pepperoni breadsticks and a large fountain drink. They do have Gold Peak iced tea, so that was a definite plus. My entire meal came in at just over $7 - certainly less than you'll pay for mall pizza, though this isn't a mall and they sure don't have the convenience factor going on. You can actually order online. \n\nI will admit that considering their location I'd expect it to be a lot nicer inside Bella. Yes, you have multiple tables where you can sit down and enjoy the meal and they certainly are decked out in the usual New York urban decor, think a grittier Subway, but it all seemed a lot more kitsch than I expected. \n\nI've seen a couple Yelp reviews refer to Bella's pizza as glorified mall pizza and, quite honestly, that's an accurate description. The sausage was chunked, which is fine, but it clearly wasn't fresh and it was barely warm. While I expect this in a mall, when I'm actually in a functioning restaurant I do have higher expectations. The pizza wasn't bad, but there's definitely no way I'd go out of my way for it. The pepperoni breadsticks were warm, though they lacked anything distinct in terms of flavor. I suppose for $7 it wasn't bad, but since I was splurging a bit on my diet I really was hoping for a tastier splurge. \n\nBella's was semi-clean. It certainly wasn't divey, but I couldn't help but notice with 3-4 employees working and about as many customers that it seemed like socializing was a higher priority than actually cleaning or keeping busy. They weren't unfriendly and I didn't feel neglected, but with a little interaction with customers they could have really created a much more positive dining experience. \n\nWith Indy really possessing a pretty good pizza scene these days, it's hard to fathom a good reason to return to Bella's. The employees didn't seem to care that I was there and, quite honestly, if you can't serve me a simple hot slice of pizza then you're really not worth my hard-earned dollars. With Napolese in the mall across the street and Puccini's not that far away, when I want a good meal I'll visit them and when I want mall pizza I'll actually go to the mall.", "date": "2015-08-08 02:25:03"}, {"review_id": "4ZjFHIsqt7nOg4UaDN-ktA", "user_id": "eWvYocztrgv-LfQiyxo4TQ", "business_id": "wHiPhPVuGnngEieDBMG00g", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "See my \"tip\" for the beginning of this from July15...

Proper portioning gets an A+ from me and Gordon Ramsey. \n\nOn my most recent visit, which was at lunch, I had veal and peppers. It's a dish I typically lean towards because it's a classic that I can't make at home. I was a bit disappointed that there was only a few chunks of veal on the plate and the rest was shredded into the sauce. I didn't order a veal meat sauce, so I really did expect veal pieces. That being said, I've had it where it's been all chunks of veal. The red sauce, or gravy, or tomato sauce, or whatever they call it- I'm too Polish to understand the Italian naming of a simple tomato based sauce- is spectacular. I really do think they have one of the best sauces around. It's the reason I order the veal and peppers. No way would I be able to make a sauce so flavorful. \n\nI've also had some bad experiences with the wait staff. Sometimes they don't ask if you want pasta or vegetables as your side- during my most recent visit I was assigned pasta while the rest of my table was asked which they would prefer.

When Blake's came to Tucson, I was really excited!!!\n\nDon't believe the hype. The green chile cheeseburger at Blake's is a mediocre burger overall with the saving grace being the green chile. The green chile is delicious but not very hot, at least for my taste but that's not where I find fault with this burger. The actual burger is greasy and just a whatever burger. Mine was thrown together so sloppily that I had more onions and tomatoes off the bun than on it. I literally had to put my burger back together before I could eat it. And then the grease started dripping off my hands. Honestly, I would compare the \"burger\" part of my sandwich to any old fast food place but priced much higher. We also had seasoned fries which were good and onion rings which were not. The size of the order of onion rings for the price was NOT a bargain at all.\n\nSo I'm glad I finally tried Blake's but I really don't think I'll be back.

Below I will explain why I say that and how it came to be.  What I want everyone who reads this review to understand is a few simple strategies. 1) Know what you want before you go to a RV dealership; 2) Do your due diligence on choosing Make, Model, Options and the Fair Price you will pay; 3) Order the coach so you have time to sell your own if possible; 4) Don't be in a rush; 5) Have all your communication in writing and if something is missing, take responsibility that you did not prepare prior to your commitment.  \nAll the above is what I did.  Why, because I read every blog I can find on the subject, watch every YouTube\u2122 video I could and listen to folks who have been RVing for decades. Every single part of my requests to Tampa RV were fulfilled prior to me even setting foot in the dealership. My sales consultant, Stephen Weaver, communication with me consistently throughout the ordering process (three months).  Everyone from the General Manager to the PDI manager called me prior to delivery.  Even the dealer sent me an email after I took delivery.  \nFolks, every aspect of my sale to delivery exceeded my expectation.  Thanks to the entire staff of Tampa RV for working so closely with me.  My hopes are everyone does their research and preparation prior to even thinking about the purchase of an RV from any dealership.  Bravo to all involved.  See my addition comments below for more information.\nThis not my first purchase of an RV/Coach.  Prior to every transaction, I do a level of due diligence that most people can't or are simply not willing to do. In the past I have been asked to speak on the subject at national conventions, pod casts, YouTube\u2122 reviews including my own and my personal blog on the RV Industry.  My goal is to be a advocate for clients to have a seamless and transparent transition with most RV dealers in the United States. I am called the \"RV Advocate\".\nOn to my review. When I finally choose my brand (AirStream), model (Interstate Grand Tour) and option package (Tommy Bahama) it was time to choose my dealership.  Since I had purchased an AirStream Trailer prior, I had gone through this process before.  It seems my prior dealer did not communicate some critical facts to me on my potential new purchase, so we parted ways as friends. My money, so my choice. I knew every single Airstream dealer is a five-state radius.  I had visited most of them. I was referred to Tampa RV (A member of the RVone Group) by a trusted Airstream friend. Tampa RV's reviews were not stellar to say the least, but I studied them very closely.  It became clear to me the issues, not only with Tampa RV, all RV dealerships I dealt with was \"professional communication\" on both the client and the dealers side.  I created a process in writing to leave \"no stone un-turn\" and the result was OUTSTANDING.", "date": "2017-12-06 00:34:10"}, {"review_id": "G0KX2tGRfm-YhTihhkr90A", "user_id": "JDneArtJlNjtdyx8y6iiMA", "business_id": "62pABDhLkUPAcNgxum_mpw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "My favorite part was the desserts.

They were on homemade potato chips, not tortilla chips, and the brisket was melt-in-your-mouth good. The barbecue sauce and cheese and sour cream and everything were so delicious.  \nThe wings had a flavor that Florida doesn't even know about. They were unique and smoked and hot and welcomed to my appetite! Lastly, the Mac and cheese, it was good and flavorful, but absolutely overshadowed by the nachos and wings.

This was my first trip to Reno as an adult. We pull up to Peppermill and it looked awesome. The valet was very nice and took all our bags. Its was a girls weekend (over-packing as per usu) and even took my board game. (I said over-packing). We walk it and its buzzing, I start feeling happy and giddy ready to have some fun with my gals. We go to check in and the gentleman there was awesome! I cant remember his name but he was employee of the year for 2012 and I can see why! So after checking in, we wander around for awhile then got to our room. Totally awesome. Great room we had a view of the pool and since it was a smoking room the windows opened! So that was the one benefit of the smoking room. Now here is where it all goes down hill. The service staff here is the worst. Except for the server at the 24 hour restaurant and our server at the steak house (i think his name was Franz). Other then that they all were horrible. Getting drinks at the bar, you would think i asked them to make 30 long islands not 2 grey hounds. And I have bar tended, so don't look at me crazy when you don't get tipped, because at this point I gave up on giving tips for shitty service. The pool service was a joke and every single staff member was completely rude. I get it you are in the heat and have to deal with people but its called fake it. I work with clients and vendors and would never act as these people had. We were told that all the cabanas were sold out and since we watched them all day, no one and I mean no one went into them at all, they were empty practically all weekend.  We went back to our hotel room and decided to play a game and guess what they never gave me the game. I called they didn't have and said to keep calling and they may find it. So i just chalked it up to the game gods and said wtf. Game was never found. As we went to our dinner the men who are at the bouncers at the club asked for our Id's (very rudely) and I asked all this for dinner (thinking maybe its a dinner club and they have a age appropriate  show) and he tells me nothing as we walk to the hostess the bouncer yells you guys aren't going to the club and at this point I'm so annoyed I yell back something like \"its 7:30 i don't know who goes to a club this early but its not us.\" Dinner was wonderful and the food was good in the 24 hour place as well. But that's about it. I did have fun but only because I was with my friends. I can sadly say I was not impressed with the staff (even the bell hop was standoffish when he came to get our bags) and that made a huge impact. I was glad I had got a packet that had this room deal because had i paid full price I would have been livid. And one last thing. I tried to book another room visit prior to this visit because it expires in September and was told that they had no more rooms for this package. So i am now out 50.00 bucks for something that I can not use. Pretty shitty deal if I say so myself.

I really didn't get a good feel for their attitude here. \n\nWhen I was there it took forever to get a drink because of how \"busy\" it was, but like I said it was mostly expected. It's tiny and a bit rundown feeling like a dive bar. Not my favorite feeling but that's part of why they don't get 5 stars from me.\n\nIf it's busy you probably won't find seating immediately. The best solution is to scope things out and play some arcade games until something opens up! \n\nThe pizza here is seriously an awesome combo while you are drinking. I love deep dish, and while black thorn isn't my all time favorite, it's pretty good for st Louis. \n\nKeep in mind deep dish takes forever to cook and when you are in line for your pizza to be made it could take an hour, which means you might already be feeling the buzz of your alcohol kick in.", "date": "2012-09-11 02:46:01"}, {"review_id": "fWZVkadgW5u8gA89kFHg1w", "user_id": "A08Z4MwB5tD69Uxpq0vZqg", "business_id": "iJKOUYgigs4VYsWny6AtEA", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Excellent thin crust pizza.

She was (*gasp* ) very attentive for an Ethiopian restaurant waitress.  The service was not as good quick as the average non-Ethiopian restaurant, but it definitely blew all the Ethiopian restaurant services away with the speed!  Gee, I wonder if it could be because she's not Ethiopian?!?!?!  hahaha  However, she did mention that she grew up in West Philly eating Ethiopian food.  mmmm I'm jealous!  \n\nAs is my custom, I went to use the bathroom and wash my hands before the meal.  Considering that Ethiopian food is eaten with one's hands, I would highly recommend this practice to all my friends .  There were two \"stalls\" in the bathroom.  Both stalls have saloon styled doors (2 halves swinging freely in the middled, hinged on either side).  The first one was lit, but the right half of the door was missing.  Given this, I opted for the second stall.  After stepping inside, I noticed a good 2 inches between the halves of the door.  Needless to say, I did my business in a hurry all the while praying that no one else would come in.  PLEASE LADIES, GO TO THE BATHROOM BEFORE EATING AT THIS RESTAURANT.  It is a harrowing experience!\n\nWhen the food came (sooner than expected), the portions were fairly generous.  When I bit into the injera at the Queen of Sheba, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was fairly sour!  It was not as sour as Abyssinia's injera, but definitely a few steps more sour than anywhere else I have tried up to date.  Now, I'm not saying ideal injera should be sour, but I like mine that way.   hahaha  Unfortunately parts of the injera were a little dried.  *sigh*   It's a toss up for me between dried injera versus more sour injera.   \n\nThe dishes were all decent, but not amazing.  My companion liked the potatoes in the carrot, string bean, potato dish.  I thought their salad was fabulous - fresh and dressed perfectly.  I did not care for the raw onions, but have to admit the taste was a nice contrast to the other dishes.  Both lentil dishes were decent, as I have said before it is difficult for me to tell much of a difference in them.  However, my trusty sidekick noted that the lentils were more watery at Kaffa Crossing.  I know that 1 of the lentil dishes was too spicy for me, but I am a big, Big wuss when it comes to spices, so that is neither here nor there.   The lamb was a big disappointment, it was a little sour (bad?).  The collard greens were pretty standard, nothing amazing.", "date": "2009-08-04 04:37:43"}, {"review_id": "85k5mcsXXAwXJOEYIVi7vg", "user_id": "SxbuVY2Vq9yvCJ6UmSj9ZA", "business_id": "SKW1zA4nY_SPKkQPmXNHoA", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Saw the rave reviews and thought would give it a shot.

The passion fruit coconut cake fell short of my expectations and was just unimpressive despite my excitement for such summery flavors. Cookie dough cake was great and packed with cookie dough.  Cookies and cream was too buttercreamy. The earl's court is great and super rich, so definitely for a chocolate lover. I have no complaints about too much rich, dark, chocolate buttercream.\n\nNoncakes - The berry topped cheesecake was gorgeous and yummy. And the coconut cream pie was the silliest I've had. It made up for what it lacked in coconut flavor with its buttery smoothness.\n\nThe latte was decent, but not great for the price.\n\nFrench bread and salted butter may be the best thing on the menu.

When I asked to speak to a manager, both gentlemen at the desk claimed to be managers. They then teamed up to make all of this seem like our fault. They kept saying they couldn't help us when we were angry, but what they were really doing was attempting to bully us into leaving through angry and condescending behavior and speech. One was especially bad. He had what seemed to be a violent temper. He had to walk away at one point and compose himself because I wouldn't just accept the fact that our reservations were lost (did I mention my colleague had checked in under the reservation two hours prior?) He was scary, and probably does not need to work with the public. He seemed proud of his behavior, like he could treat me that way because I was powerless. I asked him to call the reservation line to find out what happened. He held the phone to his ear for a while, said he was on hold and that he could call me when he knew what happened. I gave him my cell phone number. I went to our to put down luggage in the rooms they found us that had previously not existed, and when I walked through about ten minutes later to move my car, he was not on the phone nor had I received a call. I asked him what happened and he said they couldn't tell him anything. I told him I didn't appreciate how he had handled the situation, and as I walked away he yelled at me to mention his name when I called to complain. Why would a person say that? No concern or compassion for customers. I think he was mad that made a mistake and had to work to fix it, which is his job. What's really upsetting is that when I called the corporate reservation line later, they said I had had three rooms when the reservation left their system the day before. \n\nI would never stay here again. I felt like the staff couldn't handle a mix up that most likely happens on occasion. We were not going to leave after our colleague was already able to check in, with no place to go and no idea what happened, and the hotel must not have been \"full\" if they found us two rooms for the night because we wouldn't leave.\n\nThe rooms were below average, but the scary staff is the reason to stay away.", "date": "2015-11-07 12:55:48"}, {"review_id": "oBn2QAsdi0DryaUbyDTsEQ", "user_id": "4Psac6uj06y_5EPv6CL56g", "business_id": "9FxJE_UeJMlEKn7g7qkc7Q", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "This is the closest grocery store to my home.

I was also there once around 2 pm, and they were dragging a rack of old bread out to throw it away (seriously...why isn't it being donated!)...the staff person looked at me, my companion and one other woman sitting outside and told us we could take as much home for free as we wanted since it was going into the dumpster.
